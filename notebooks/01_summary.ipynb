    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a method to render an ECG deep-learning model interpretable to physicians. By ensuring that its decisions are transparent, clinicians and hospitals are more likely to trust and adopt it. Moreover, this approach aligns closely with the requirements of the EU AI Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset to classify heartbeats, we faced two main challenges: class imbalance and beats that are not aligned in time.  \n",
    "We address these issues with two different preprocessing pipelines and a residual 1-D CNN. The final model is highly accurate, and SHAP values reveal which moments in each beat guide its predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **➤➤ Key Take Aways:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Goal** – Build an interpretable ECG classifier that meets clinical and regulatory needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Dataset** – MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset for Rhythmological Classification (109 446 beats, 5 classes, sampled at 125 Hz). \n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Model** –  Deep-learning model with task-optimized architecture highlighting three Residual Blocks in combination with two Dense and Dropout layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Class Balancing** – Oversampling and Data Augmentation of Minority Classes -  Maintaining physiological ECG curve integrity while adding noise using Gaussian jitter\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Data Challenges** \n",
    "  1. Strong class Imbalance with underrepresentation of class 1 & 3 \n",
    "  2. In contrast to individual signals, the mean signals by class do not allow clear correlation to the different phases of the heart cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Two Pre-processors** - Goal: Achieve Global Interpretability through P-QRS-T Signal Alignment\n",
    "  1. *High Data Alteration* – deletes 22 columns and left-shifts most signals for perfect R-peak alignment.  \n",
    "  2. *Low Data Alteration* – keeps all columns and right-shifts signals, losing less information.  \n",
    " \n",
    "- ✅ **Performance** \n",
    "\n",
    "  – Original Data: ≈ 99 % test accuracy; weighted F1-score 0.9886 - excellent model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "  – Preprocessor 1 : ≈ 97 % test accuracy; weighted F1-score 0.9728 - significant Drop in recall of minority Classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "  – Preprocessor 2 : ≈ 98 % test accuracy; weighted F1-score 0.9791 - improved Recall and overall F1-Score for minority Classes while maintaining high performance for the majority classes\n",
    "\n",
    "    ➤ Preprocessor 2 represents an excellent compromise between interpretability and overall model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ **Explainability** – SHAP shows which parts of the P, QRS, and T waves drive each prediction — now allowing direct correlation of SHAP values to the different phases of the heart cycle"
